# Nutrition__Physical_Activity__and_Obesity_-_Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System
The Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset is a collection of health-related data that tracks key indicators related to nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in different population groups. This dataset is essential for understanding public health trends, identifying risk factors, and shaping policies to promote healthier lifestyles.

Dataset Description

This dataset contains survey-based data collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The data includes:
Nutritional habits (e.g., fruit and vegetable consumption)

 ->Physical activity levels

 ->Obesity and weight status

 ->Demographic information (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level)

 ->Geographical data (state-level and national trends)

Project Scope

This project involves:

âœ… Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, filtering necessary fields, and ensuring consistency.

âœ… Data Analysis â€“ Summarizing key health trends using Pivot Tables.

âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Creating an interactive dashboard using MS Excel to showcase trends.

Visualizations

The Excel Dashboard provides insights through:

ðŸ“Š Bar Charts â€“ Comparing nutrition, obesity, and physical activity levels.

ðŸ“ˆ Line Charts â€“ Showing trends across different health factors.

ðŸ¥§ Pie Charts â€“ Displaying proportional distribution of key metrics.

Key Insights

ðŸ”¹ Obesity levels are significantly higher compared to fruit and vegetable consumption.

ðŸ”¹ Physical activity has a stronger presence in the dataset, indicating better tracking of fitness habits.

ðŸ”¹ Nutritional habits (fruits & vegetables) need more focus, as they show the lowest recorded values.

Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive look at public health trends related to nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. The dashboard makes it easy to understand key health factors, helping policymakers, researchers, and the public make data-driven decisions for a healthier future.
